# Devironment
Definition: Development Environment Setup


Various Config files for development machine environment setup

Each time I setup a development environment on a new machine - I must hunt down all my
necessary tools, re-config my Vim editor and other software. :(

To save this hassel I'm running this Git Repo to make it easy to deploy new machines
with the tools and configs to make my devironment nice and comfyyy

Git for much win =)
