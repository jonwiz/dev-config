# dev-config
Various Config files for development machine environment setup

Each time I setup a development environment on a new machine - I gotta hunt down all my
necessary tools and download them.

To save this hassel I'm runnins this Git Repo to make it easy to deploy new machines
with the tools and configs to make my comfortable rapid development environment.

Git for much win =)
